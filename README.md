R.temp ddRAD analysis with genome



## MS1: Range-wide adaptation to environment in R.temp

Adapation to temp and season length across different gradients. 


1. Which driver is more important across each gradient? 
2. Are the same loci/genomic regions associated with adaptation? 
3. Is the genomic architecture the same i.t.o pleoitropy (see below)
