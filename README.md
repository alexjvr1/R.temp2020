## MS1: Range-wide adaptation to environment in R.temp (SE & CH)

Adapation to temp and season length across different gradients. 


1. Which driver is more important across each gradient? 
2. Are the same loci/genomic regions associated with adaptation? 
3. Is the genomic architecture the same i.t.o pleoitropy (see below)

## MS2: Adaptive introgression in Switzerland

Southern and Northern haplogroups meet in Eastern Switzerland. We characterise gene flow across the contact zone and ask: 

1) Is there adaptive introgression? 
2) In which direction? (mito-nucleur mismatch)
3) Were these outliers previously identified as associated with environment? 
4) What are the possible gene functions of these loci? 


## MS3: Local adaptation to environmental variables in Switzerland

Adpatation is local (scale dependent). And different environmental variables are important in different parts of the range.
